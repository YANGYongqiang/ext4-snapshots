config NEXT3_FS
	tristate "Next3 journalling file system support"
	select JBD
	help
	  This is the journalling version of the Second extended file system
	  (often called next3), the de facto standard Linux file system
	  (method to organize files on a storage device) for hard disks.

	  The journalling code included in this driver means you do not have
	  to run e2fsck (file system checker) on your file systems after a
	  crash.  The journal keeps track of any changes that were being made
	  at the time the system crashed, and can ensure that your file system
	  is consistent without the need for a lengthy check.

	  Other than adding the journal to the file system, the on-disk format
	  of next3 is identical to ext2.  It is possible to freely switch
	  between using the next3 driver and the ext2 driver, as long as the
	  file system has been cleanly unmounted, or e2fsck is run on the file
	  system.

	  To add a journal on an existing ext2 file system or change the
	  behavior of next3 file systems, you can use the tune2fs utility ("man
	  tune2fs").  To modify attributes of files and directories on next3
	  file systems, use chattr ("man chattr").  You need to be using
	  e2fsprogs version 1.20 or later in order to create next3 journals
	  (available at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/e2fsprogs/>).

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called next3.

config NEXT3_DEFAULTS_TO_ORDERED
	bool "Default to 'data=ordered' in next3"
	depends on NEXT3_FS
	help
	  The journal mode options for next3 have different tradeoffs
	  between when data is guaranteed to be on disk and
	  performance.	The use of "data=writeback" can cause
	  unwritten data to appear in files after an system crash or
	  power failure, which can be a security issue.	 However,
	  "data=ordered" mode can also result in major performance
	  problems, including seconds-long delays before an fsync()
	  call returns.	 For details, see:

	  http://ext4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Next3_data_mode_tradeoffs

	  If you have been historically happy with next3's performance,
	  data=ordered mode will be a safe choice and you should
	  answer 'y' here.  If you understand the reliability and data
	  privacy issues of data=writeback and are willing to make
	  that trade off, answer 'n'.

config NEXT3_FS_XATTR

	  On snapshot create, a few special blocks (i.e. the super block and

	  Current implementation of journal_release_buffer() in JBD is empty,
	  since no buffer credtis are used until the buffer is marked dirty.
	  However, because resulting snapshot COW operation cannot be undone,
	  we try to extend the current transaction to compensate for the used
	  credits of the extra COW operation, so we don't run out of buffer
	  credits too soon.

	  the orphan inode list functions to manipulate the snapshot list.
	  Unlink and truncate of snapshot inodes on the list is not allowed,

	  tasks, find the 'new' buffer in the buffer cache and have to wait
	  until the buffer_new flag is cleared.  The COWing task copies the
	  source buffer into the 'new' buffer, unlocks it, marks it as journal
	  dirty data, clears the new_buffer flag and drops its reference count.
	  On active snapshot readpage, the buffer cache is checked.
